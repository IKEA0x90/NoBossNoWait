# NoBossNoWait
Skips the teleporter charging after the boss is defeated while still adding the time it would have taken. 
Takes Focused Convergence into account with a stack up to 3.
"Assumes that your team is not trash and all of you would have been in the teleporter zone for the remaining duration".
Special thanks to the creator of the original mod, Arbition.
